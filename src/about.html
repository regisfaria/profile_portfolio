           I'm a computer engenier student, that loves programming. Always searching for new techs
          and on how to build and deploy valuable applications, in many variates ways.
          </br>
          </br>
           I like to pratice sports and loves to thinks on new ways to link the technology into sports, 
          making then even more interesting.
          </br>
          </br>
           I'm working with programming for 2 years, and I've learned to program 4 yeas ago(2016). Ever since
          I've never stopped programming. I've participated in Programming contests, solved a lot of URI problems and
          worked on a community Makerspace.
          </br>
          </br>
           I work fast and aim to deliver my projects's mvp as fast as I can, so we can have real world improvements, since
          users are testing it.

        <div>
          My Graduation studies are being done at UFSC(Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina).
          </br></br>
          At UFSC, I have contact with a variaty of PhD Teachers, all of then with a lot of experiences to share.
          I'm also part of some extension projects, where we create projects, helping the community.
          </br></br>
          In my Graduation time, I'm having the experience of being a scientific research student, developing a project
          on educational levels, using machine learning to show teachers which of their students are having problems with studies.

        <img src="../assets/rocketseat.png" id="rocketseat" alt="">
        <div>
          Right now, I'm doing my studies both at UFSC and at Rocketseat, a online educational group of programmers, where they
          teach web programming.
          </br></br>
          I'm taking part at two of their bootcamps. LaunchBase, where we learn the base of the web programming and GoStack 
          which gives focus on a more advancing web programming, using Typescript, React and React Native.
          </br></br>
          Studying at Rocketseat is being a very pleasent experience. I'm learning so many new things about the most modern 
          web programming fullstack. It's one more step to be a developer.
