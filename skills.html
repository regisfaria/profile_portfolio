            I love Python! <i class="material-icons" id="heart">favorite</i>
            </br>
            </br>
            I have 2 years of experience programming in Python and over those years, I've learned Machine Learning Algorithms,
            Data Science, Computational Vision, Web Scrapping and REST APIs.
            <br>
            <br>
            It's the language I like most to work with!

            <br><br>
            My experience with node is recent. I've submit myself to study online courses from rocketseat, where I'm learning
            to develop a lot of web application using nodeJS.
            <br><br>
            It is a wonderful technology and I'm getting along very nicely.

            <br><br>
            Typescript is a great tech to build big applications, making much easier to give support and maintence on the code.
            <br><br>
            Besides that, we can still use it's latests JS functionalities, staying always up to date with the latests changes.

            <br><br>
            React bring alongs with it the container concept, where every element in the page is a container.
            So with it, we can stop repeating code and get great results when programming a page.
            <br><br>
            With React and React Native I can build SPA's(Single page applications), where it's usage is so clean and perfomaticly for both 
            Web and Mobile.
            <br><br>
            This webpage will recive a React update in a near future.

            Linux has been my favorite OS since I've started programming.
            <br><br>
            Over the years, I've learned many shell features that helps on development.
            <br><br>
            My linux experience grows with each passing day, since It's my OS and every day I have to learn something new 
            that helps on the development of something I'm working.

            I've learned Web programming since I've started to code. Altough I haven't exercized it over the years.
            <br>
            Now, learning React, my interest for Web programming have growth, and I'm starting to practice HTML and CSS again.active
            <br><br>
            This website is an exemple of one project build only using simple HTML, JS and CSS to sharpen my skills.

            <br><br>
            Using git as source control it's most useful skill for any programmer.
            <br>
            Ever since I've started programming, I've been learning Git all along, so I can always keep my codes published and 
            get a better insight over my coding skills.
            <br><br>
            I had the experience of using git to source control a project along with more people, and it is indispensable.
            <br><br>
            My git skills improves every day, since I'm always coding and using git to publish and release features.

            I'm starting to develop some React Native apps for Android and I'm in love with this tech!
            <br>
            It's so easy to develop and publish one application with it.
            <br><br>
            I have some android projects that will be published soon enought.

            Database is essential for any kind of applications.
            <br>
            My knowledge with databases started soon as I've learned to program. It's a most have for many apps.
            <br><br>
            I've used different kinds of Databases, including MySQL, Postgres, MariaDB, etc...
            <br><br>
            I had the experience of working with the Moodle's Database, a big one, with many relationships. This project 
            helped my to grow my understanding of databases and making complex queries.
